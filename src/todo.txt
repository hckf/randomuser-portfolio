Blog.js
- Initially implement the same modal system as the Projects page. It would probably be better to re-render the article itself as its own page.

Footer.js
- Fix footer positioning -> needs to be situated at the bottom of the page, not fixed to the bottom of the viewport.

Projects.js
- Center project grid - justify-items/content doesn't appear to center appropriately, find out why CSS grid is doing this.
